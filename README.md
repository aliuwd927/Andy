# Hi, I'm Andy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer whose passionate about learning. Ever since I learned JavaScript, I've been curious as to how far I can personally take this language to,
and possbily pick up a new language or two in the future. I would like to expand my knowledge of Javascript with IoT & Robotics. So far, biggest my long term robotics projects are my DJI Tello , MBot, and PS4 Controller / XBox Controller. I find drones highly facinating, but as I grow as a web developer, I would also like to blend drones and the web together, and explore possbilities.

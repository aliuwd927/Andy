# Hi, I'm Andy 

I'm a web developer whose passionate about learning. Ever since, I learned javascript, I'm curious about how far I can personally take it. 
Someday, I would like to expand my knowledge of Javascript with IoT / Robotics. So far, biggest my long term robotics projects are 
DJI Tello , MBot, and PS4 Controller. As I grow as a web develoer, I would also like to blend drones and the web together, and see the possbilities.
Technologies I am working with are ReactJS,TypeScript, and Node.
